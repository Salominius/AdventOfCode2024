# AdventOfCode2024
My approach on Advent Of Code this year using Python

## Structure
* ``helpers`` contains any functions that I think might be usefull more than once.
I will probably add more generic functions there, as the days get more difficult.
* ``inputs`` contains all inputs in numbered files (``input##.txt``).

## Run
To run the code, create a subfolder in the root directory called ``inputs`` and put the input files there.
example:
```
AdventOfCode2024
│   helpers
|     importHelpers.py
│   inputs
|     input01.txt
|   day01.py
```
Then just run any day file and see the result printed in the console.
